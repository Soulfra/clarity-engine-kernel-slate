# Admin Panel

This folder contains administrative information for the Soulfra Vault Kernel system.

- `credits.json` - tracks user credit balances (earned, spent, staked).
- `kernel_ownership.json` - manual ledger showing Soulfra and contributor equity.
- `vault_registry.json` (root) - index of all vaults and loop results.

Edit these files directly to update balances or ownership. A future UI will read from this directory.
