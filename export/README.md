# Export Directory

This folder contains ZIP archives generated by `kernel_export.js`. Each
export deducts credits, validates fingerprints, and logs metadata to
`admin/export_log.json` and the vault's own `export_log.json`.

Export pricing: **50 credits** per export. If a vault metadata file
includes `referred_by`, a buyback of 20 credits is logged in
`admin/buyback_log.json`.
