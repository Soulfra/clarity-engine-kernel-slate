# Self-Healing Logs & File Creation Standard

> See also: `../shared/utils/ensureFileAndDir.js`, `tests/core/backup-buildup.e2e.test.js`

## Rationale
- Prevents errors from missing files or directories
- Ensures all logs and outputs are always available
- Makes the system robust, onboarding-friendly, and zero-downtime

## Usage
- Use `ensureFileAndDir(filePath)` before writing to any file or log
- Automatically creates parent directories and the file if missing
- Safe to call multiple times (idempotent)

## Example
```js
const ensureFileAndDir = require('../../shared/utils/ensureFileAndDir');
ensureFileAndDir('logs/error.log');
fs.appendFileSync('logs/error.log', 'Error: ...\n');
```

## Onboarding Notes
- All new features must use this standard for file/log writes
- E2E tests must validate self-healing behavior
- Reference this doc in onboarding and handoff materials

*This standard is required for all file and log writes in the kernel slate. Update as needed for new patterns.*
